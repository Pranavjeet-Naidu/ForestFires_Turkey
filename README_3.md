# Hypothesis testing 
    We have two hypotheses :
    * Null Hypothesis
    * Alterntive Hypothesis
  The tests we use that are related to hypothesis testing are
    * Qualitative  : Ky-Square
    * Quantitative : Z-test , P-test , ANOVA
  They deal with P-Value (quantitative) and KPSS and ADF tests are two similar ones that deal with the P-value . The value has a pre-determined linmit used to 
  accept or reject the null hypothesis . 
  
   # NOTE :We use the IQR (q1,q2,q3) to draw Box plots . These are a great way to check for Outliers

# Predictive testing :    
    we use models like :
    * ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) :
       It uses three parameters (p,q,d) . They can be found using the PACF , ACF graphs and differentation respectively .
    * SARIMA :
       True to its namesake (Seasonal ARIMA) , it deals with an extra parameter that is used for seasonality
    * Facebook Prophet
    * Holt-Winters
