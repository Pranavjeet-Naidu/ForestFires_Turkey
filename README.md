A glossary of the terms introduced to in class :
EDA - Explonatory Data analysis
MAE - Mean Absolute Error
MAPE - Mean Absolute percentage error 
Note : Given how MAE and MAPE work , the lower the values of them , the better for the data in question , But too low of a value can mean something wrong in the dataset .
