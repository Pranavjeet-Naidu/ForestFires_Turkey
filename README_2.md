# README_2
This is a readme file about the perspective of a business . We speak about different terms like business outcomes and actions , the two types of presentations .

# Representaion 
We perform tasks such as data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering. The goal is to transform raw data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling. Proper data representation ensures that relevant information is captured and can lead to more accurate insights. We also use visualizations such as charts and graphs . This makes complex data more accessible to business stakeholders, facilitating better decision-making.

# Business Outcomes 
Business outcomes are the desired results or objectives that an organization aims to achieve through data science initiatives. These objectives should be clearly defined and aligned with the organization's goals. Examples of business outcomes include increasing revenue, reducing costs, enhancing inventory management efficiency (to prevent stock-outs or stock-excess) .

We use the data provided (mostly timeseries) to build predictive models that forecast future business outcomes based on historical data. For example, predictive models can help forecast sales, customer churn, or equipment failures, enabling proactive decision-making.

# Actions:

Our ultimate goalin a business context is to generate actionable insights. Such as recommending specific actions to achieve desired outcomes. For instance, a prescriptive model might suggest adjusting pricing strategies, launching targeted marketing campaigns, or optimizing supply chain logistics.

# The presentations
  We make 2 kinds of presentations: 
   * Technical Presentation for Peers and Data Teams:
       In this presentation, the primary audience is typically fellow data scientists, analysts within the organization.
       The technical PPT dives deep into the data science process, methodologies, algorithms, and technical details. It may include code snippets, model 
       architecture diagrams, data preprocessing steps, and model evaluation metrics.
       The purpose is to share insights into the technical aspects of the data science work, discuss the challenges faced, present the methodology used, and 
       seek feedback from peers. It is a forum for technical discussions and collaboration.
   * Business or Stakeholder Presentation:
       In this presentation, the audience typically consists of non-technical stakeholders, such as executives, managers, marketing teams, or clients.
       The business PPT focuses on high-level insights, key findings, actionable recommendations, and the impact of data science on business outcomes. It 
       uses non-technical language and emphasizes the business value derived from the data analysis.
       The purpose is to communicate the business implications of the data science work, provide actionable insights that drive decision-making, and justify 
       the investment in data science initiatives. It may also help secure buy-in and funding for future projects.
